I read from stocks.txt (by default).
I add all my the contents of stocks.txt into a string vector.
then I display a menu for the user.
based on the users input I perform some task.
If the user presses 1, I ask the user to enter a stock ticker,
then i display that stockâ€™s max price, min price and average.
If the user presses 2, I display the stock with the highest price and the value.
If the user presses 3, I display the stock with the lowest price and the value.
If the user presses c or C, I ask them to enter the new file that they want to read.
If the user presses q, I exit the program.
